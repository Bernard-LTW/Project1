# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:
I will to design and make a **digital ledger** for a client who is **Mr Sato**. The **digital ledger** will about **cryptocurrency** and is constructed using the software **Python** It will take  **until Project Week** to make and will be evaluated according to the criterias below.

Justify the tools/structure of your solution
I will be using Python for this solution becasue it provides easy data scraping functions and various libraries which could help in providing useful statistics to Mr Sato

I will be choosing Ethereum(ETHUSD) as my cryptocurrency for this solution

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger shows past records of the cryptocurrency selected.
5. The electronic ledger shows useful statistics such as overall gain/loss
6. The electronic ledger allows to search for transactions on a particular day



# Criteria B: Design

## System Diagram

## Flow Diagrams
